    "# Introduction to xarray and dask for geoscientists\n",
    "\n",
    "A short course offered by Texas A&M High Performance Research Computing in Spring 2021. Short course home page: https://hprc.tamu.edu/training/intro_xarray_dask.html\n",
    "\n",
    "This short course will cover some basics of using the Pangeo collection of python-based utilities, such as xarray and dask, to process and visualize output from General Circulation Models (GCMs). Dask lazy loading and parallelization potentially allows researchers to scale their computations from their laptops to supercomputing clusters. We will use model output from CESM, in the netCDF format, to generate climatology and time-averages, visualize quantities, resample data, perform interpolations in the vertical coordinates, and look at how to parallelize xarray-based computations using the dask library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of this course are based on the excellent training materials offered by the xarray, dask, and Pangeo communities. See `Useful links` below. \n",
